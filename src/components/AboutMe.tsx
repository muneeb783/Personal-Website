              Hi! I'm Muneeb Ali Asif, a passionate Computer Science student at Georgia Tech. 
              My interest in technology began at a young age, and I am now focused on developing 
              innovative software solutions and exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am diving deep into various technologies including AI, machine learning, 
              and robotics. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me participating in student clubs, 
              enjoying outdoor activities, or experimenting with new ideas in tech.
            </p>
